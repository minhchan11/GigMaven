# GigMaven - A service provider and credit system

#### Context:
COVID-19 has made many people unemployed and businesses unoperational. People are looking for ways to make a living safely while preventing high overhead cost or worsen the pandemic. GigMaven is a conceptual platform to solve such problem by delivering services on wheels while capitalizing on credit resources. 

###### Service Component:
1. Due to COVID-19, service providers of the app need to have a car and follow a strict sanitization protocol every day. They will need to send proof of that either through videos or images taken with the app itself. It will be displayed as "last sanitize check" on their posting page. 
2. Potential drivers will be vetted thoroughly through different check, both personal driving records and vehicle record. If passed, they are added to the system and given an initial score.
3. Each driver can enrich their profiles and scores with credentials or testimonials from past customers (who need to verify their identity and proof of service) to increase their score.
4. Driver can upload image or videos of their service to be featured on the "Carousel" page. If they can't come up with original content, they will need to fill in a form for an auto-generated post that sticks with the app aesthetics. Drivers could provide service from delivery to moving to odd tasks. 
5. Driver can earn more points (daily restrictions) if their customers think that their service is beyond expectations. Verified testimonial will help them bubble up on the "Carousel" page. They don't lose point if the service is not up to par or disputed. 
6. Driver can price their own service and customer can also bid for their service. They will pledge to deliver a service by the time and amount promised, otherwise the customer will be entitled to an automatic discount and driver will bubble down on the "Carousel" page. Customer can choose their drivers through hashtag as well to show support such as: #BlackOwnedBusiness, #NeighborhoodVeteran,... They can also see the driver's personal story when they click on the profile. 
7. Driver protection: If customers are harrassing, displaying unsafe behavior, the earlier they report the less points they will lose. There is integrated API and IoT device(headband) that they could use to record their activities. 
8. Customer protection: If drivers are harrassing or displaying unsafe behavior (attitude not a component), customers can talk directly to agents to report and file a police complaint. 

###### Credit Component
1. Driver could redeem their money from the credit that they worked as soon as daily. However, the longer they allow their credit to sit and prosper, the more benefits they could have. 
2. There is a sliding scale of interests such as weekly, biweekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 months, which increases also with the accumulating credit.
3. Instead of cash, driver could also redeem other drivers services or use as purchasing unit at partner's.
4. Drivers could team up together to accumulate service to purchase a partner's product or redeem the splitted money. 
5. Drivers could also "borrow" credits (with limitations) and work to offset such credits to minus in their future pay roll.
6. Rewards: Driver could participate in small games or events on the app to earn small credits. This includes: answering survey, participating in focus group, watching ads,...
